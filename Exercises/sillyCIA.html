        <h4>Director Demands Investigation</h4></br>

            LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed 
            that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information 
            with black highlighters.</br></br>

            According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred 
            by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret_ highlighting policy 
            that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</br></br>
            
            CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of 
            several historic events, such as: </br></br>
        
            <ul>
                <li>the cold war</li>
                <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
                <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
            </ul></br></br>
