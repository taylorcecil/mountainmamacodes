            Hi! I'm Taylor. I'm a Salt Lake City based wedding, engagement, and elopement photographer.
            I spend my time outdoors, reading, practicing yoga, and loving on my chocolate lab pups, Jade + Willow.
            I've been doing wedding photography and portraits for 5 years. 
            My mom was an amazing film wedding photographer, and growing up I'd play her little assistant, 
            following her around with a disposable camera. You could say the apple doesnâ€™t fall far from the tree.
            There's always been something about capturing + perfecting those important, 
            meaningful moments to hold onto for the rest of your life. 
            I'm all about photographing in a timeless, genuine way. 
            I want you to look back at your photos and feel as if you're reliving those special moments, 
            and all of their <i><strong>imperfectly perfect, and authentic details.</strong></i>
            </p>
